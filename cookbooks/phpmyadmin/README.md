Usage
=====

The cookbook installs the selected PMA version to /opt/phpmyadmin (or anywhere else you may have defined in the 'home' attribute) and optionally defines an FPM pool for NGINX or Apache2/mod_fcgid

To define a database config you can use the phpmyadmin_db LWRP such as:

	phpmyadmin_db 'Test DB' do
		host '127.0.0.1'
		port 3306
		username 'root'
		password 'password'
		hide_dbs %w{ information_schema mysql phpmyadmin performance_schema }
	end

This will create a file in /opt/phpmyadmin/conf.d/test_db.inc.php and will be automatically included when you display the PMA page.
